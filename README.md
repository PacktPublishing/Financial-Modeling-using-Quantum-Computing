## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter04.

The code will look like the following:
```
import numpy as np 
from scipy.stats import norm 
t = 1.0 # year 
K = 105 # Strike price 
r = 0.05 # Riskless short rate 
sigma = 0.25 # Volatility (stdev) 
S0 = 100 # Present price
```

## Errata

* Page 160 (Chapter 6): **Balanced Accuracy, or ROC-AUC score** _should be_ **Balanced Accuracy, and ROC-AUC score** 
* Page 161 (Chapter 6): **AUC** being equivalent to **Balanced Accuracy** is a simplification over binary outcome which is not the case when using probabilistic outcome (```.predict_proba()```) for classification.

**Following is what you need for this book:**
